Title: Global optimization using focussed random search
Description: Global optimization of arbitrary discrete and numeric functions using focussed 
  random search. The parameter set is iteratively shrunk to half its original size in the numeric case, or by dropping levels in
  the discrete case in order to allow for better exploration of important areas of the parameter space.
